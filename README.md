## Design Patterns Learning Repository

---

Welcome to my Design Patterns Learning Repository.
This project is created to study and practice the most important Software Design Patterns in object-oriented programming.


Design patterns help developers write clean, reusable, maintainable, and scalable code.
This repository contains examples, explanations, and simple implementations for learning purposes.

---

### Goals

* Understand core design pattern concepts 
* Improve object-oriented design skills 
* Write clean and maintainable code 
* Prepare for real-world software development

---

### Categories of Design Patterns

Design patterns are divided into three main categories:

#### 1. Creational Patterns

Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a suitable way depending on the situation.

Patterns included:
* Singleton 
* Factory Method
* Abstract Factory 
* Builder 
* Prototype

#### 2. Structural Patterns

Structural patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures while keeping them flexible and efficient.

Patterns included:
* Adapter 
* Bridge 
* Composite 
* Decorator 
* Facade 
* Flyweight 
* Proxy

#### 3. Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects and how responsibilities are distributed.

Patterns included:
* Chain of Responsibility 
* Command 
* Iterator 
* Mediator 
* Memento 
* Observer 
* State 
* Strategy 
* Template Method 
* Visitor

---

### Technologies Used
* Java (Primary language)
* OOP Principles 
* UML (for diagrams)

---

### Learning Notes
* Each pattern includes:
  * Explanation 
  * UML Diagram (if available)
  * Simple Example 
  * Real-world Use Case

---

### Future Improvements

* Add more real-world examples 
* Add UML diagrams for all patterns 
* Add Spring Boot examples using design patterns 
* Add comparison between patterns
